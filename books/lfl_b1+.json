No one in my family had ever been to London before, and I think my parents were more excited than me! They had told me to take lots of photos. Anyway, back to the story. It was the day of a visit to the Tower of London. As we were talking there with our teacher, I saw a great view of the river, and I stopped to take a photo. But when I looked for my classmates, they had disappeared! I didn’t know which way to go. I remember feeling really scared because I couldn’t really speak English then, and London is a huge city. Luckily, I heard a couple speaking Italian. I asked them if they knew where the Tower of London was. They were very kind, and they gave me a map. I ran there, and my teacher and classmates were waiting for me. We had missed our guided tour, but we did one an hour later instead. So all in all, it wasn’t a disaster.\n\n"

They are worried because of the development of modern technology and they think that life is more stressful now. They used to write letters and postcards to their friends. It must have been really nice to receive a real letter. On the other hand, they could only use the house phone to call their friends. Having unlimited access to the Internet only costs 20 euros a month. I think that’s a bargain.

        "4\nStudents’ own answer. Possible answer: Last week, I bought a new smartphone. Mine had become so slow, and the battery ran down in just a couple of hours. I did an online search, and found out that there were three mobile phone shops in the new shopping centre in the city centre called Shopping Heaven. Outside, there was a map with the names of the shops and it looked impressive because all the big names were there. However, it was a bit chaotic inside because not all the shops are open yet. In the end, I found two of the shops open and I was really impressed by the shop assistants’ knowledge in both shops. Mobile Madness has an outstanding range and the prices were reasonable. It’s a real find for anyone who needs a new phone. Phones on the Move sells fewer brands, but they’re all the latest models. The one drawback is that most of them are very expensive, so I went back to Mobile Madness to buy mine. I recommend visiting Shopping Heaven in a few months if you can. More shops will be open then. At the moment it’s a bit uninviting.\n\n"

The other problem is your parents. If I were you, I’d tell them it’s broken, but whatever you do, don’t say your friend broke it until you know the truth. My advice is to talk to your friend, but stay chilled. You mustn’t make it sound like you’re accusing him. If he says he didn’t break it, you should believe him. Don’t go on about it. Meanwhile, tell your parents, but explain that you don’t know how it got broken. Perhaps you could take it to a shop first and ask how much it will cost to fix it. It might not be expensive. Anyway, I’m sure you’ll find an answer. But whatever you do, remember not to lend him anything expensive again. Hope everything goes well! Marco\n\n"

Some people say that since there is a growing population, we have to use genetically modified food to feed the world. However, I am not convinced that it’s the best solution. In the first place, we waste too much of the food we produce. In western countries, people throw away thousands of tonnes of unused food every year. In addition, some fruit and vegetables are left in the fields because of their appearance. Supermarkets claim people will only buy ‘perfect’ fruit and vegetables. It seems clear to me that if we used this food, there would be more to help feed the world. Secondly, there are problems with some genetically modified food as modifications allow more chemicals to be used. This can’t be good for our health. Thirdly, farmers can’t always use the seed from genetically modified plants and they have to buy new seed every year. That makes genetically modified crops very expensive for small farms, particularly in Africa and Asia. To summarise, we don’t need genetically modified food to feed the world. We need to make sure we don’t waste what we produce.\n\n"

        "3\nToday, I’d like to talk to you about mobile phones. I think the mobile phone is the most significant invention. There are a number of reasons that explain my view. First of all, they are great for keeping in touch with people, especially if your friends and families live far away. Secondly, mobile phones can be really useful in an emergency. If you’re hurt or in danger, you can use your phone to call the police or an ambulance. If you didn’t have a mobile phone, you would have to wait for someone to find you. There are arguments on both sides, and some people think that we spend too much time on our phones these days. It’s true that it’s possible to waste a lot of time on your phone - taking selfies and playing games. But I’d like to finish by saying this: I strongly believe that we’d miss mobile phones if we didn’t have them.\n\n",
        "4\nSolving problems is best done in teams. For example, as a species, humans often need to deal with new threats, such as viruses or diseases. If you aim to develop a cure for these, you need to remember that it takes a long time and a lot of people. Most scientific explorations and inventions nowadays are the work of large teams, which often come from several different countries. If we can’t collaborate across national frontiers, science will become more difficult.\n\nWB "

        "4\nA Have you seen this advert? They’re asking for volunteers for a local reading project.\nB Oh yes, I heard about that. Are you interested?\nA Maybe. Here’s the advert. It says that ideally, they’re looking for reliable, responsible young adults who enjoy meeting new people.\nB What does it involve, exactly?\nA The advert says that it involves reading to very young children, old people or disabled people.\nB That sounds interesting. But I’m not sure if I’m the right type of person. I’m a bit of an introvert, and it sounds like you have to enjoy being with people.\nA I’m the opposite. I love meeting new people.\nB Is there any more information?\nA Yes, it says you should be enthusiastic about reading - for example, novels, magazines, children’s stories, biographies.\nB So are you going to do it?\nA Yes, I am. I think it sounds like a great project.\n",
        "5\nIt is often said that we like people whose personality is different from ours. A sociable person is often friends with somebody who is more of an introvert. Two leaders won’t get on with each other. But have you ever asked yourself if it’s true? My best friend and I are both adventurous and confident people, which seems to show that similar characters can like each other. ==WB "
