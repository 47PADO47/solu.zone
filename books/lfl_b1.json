        "3\nf To choose a business, think about what you are good at, what you know a lot about and what types of business your area needs.\nc You probably won’t make a lot of money in your first year or two. So you will need money to invest in the business and for your living costs during this time.\ne It’s a matter of convincing a bank that your idea is good. If they refuse, you can try other banks and financial organisations. Check out the Start Your Own Business section of the government website.\na The obvious answer is that, to start planning, it’s a good idea to write down all the questions you need to ask. Then find the answers. This will take time and energy!\nb There are lots of business advisors on the Internet. If you’d like to know more about your business area, look at their websites carefully and contact one.\nd Unfortunately, there’s no easy answer to this question. Some towns are better than others for certain types of business. You will need to do your research carefully to find the best place for your particular business.\n"
